first of the following essays originally appeared in July, 1880, the
thanks of the writer are due for permission to re-publish in the

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>The first of the Essays following appeared in "<span class="smcap">Scribner's Monthly</span>," in
July, 1880; and immediately became honored by the attention of the
Medical Press throughout the country. The aggressive title of the
paper, justified, in great measure, perhaps, the vigor of the
criticism bestowed. Again and again the point was raised by reviewers
that the problem presented by the title, was not solved or answered by
the article itself.</p>

<p>At this day, it perhaps may be mentioned that the question&mdash;"Does
Vivisection Pay?" was never raised by the writer, who selected as his
title the single word "Vivisection." The more taking headline was
affixed by the editor of the magazine as more apt to arrest attention
and arouse professional pugnacity. That in this latter respect it was
eminently successful, the author had the best reason to remember. With
this explanation&mdash;which is made simply to prevent future criticism
on the same point&mdash;the old title is retained. If the present reader
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
continues the inquiry here presented, he will learn wherein the writer
believes in the utility of vivisection, and on the other hand, in what
respects and under what conditions he very seriously questions whether
any gains can possibly compensate the infinitely great cost.</p>

<p>"What do you hope for or expect as the result of agitation in regard
to vivisection?" recently inquired a friend; "its legal abolition?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Would you then expect its restriction during the present century?"</p>

<p>"Hardly even so soon as that. It will take longer than a dozen years
to awaken recognition of any evil which touches neither the purse nor
personal comfort of an American citizen. All that can be hoped in the
immediate future is education. Action will perhaps follow when its
necessity is recognized generally; but not before."</p>

<p>For myself, I believe no permanent or effective reform of present practices
is probable until the Medical Profession generally concede as dangerous and
unnecessary that freedom of unlimited experimentation in pain, which is claimed
and practiced to-day. That legislative reform is otherwise unattainable, one
would hesitate to affirm; but it assuredly would be vastly less effective.
You must convince men of the justice and reasonableness of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
law before you can secure a willing obedience. Yielding to none in
loyalty to the science, and enthusiasm for the Art of Healing, what
standpoint may be taken by those of the Medical Profession who desire
to reform evils which confessedly exist?</p>

<p>I. We need not seek the total abolition of all experiments upon living
animals. I do not forget that just such abolition is energetically
demanded by a large number of earnest men and women, who have lost all
faith in the possibility of restricting an abuse, if it be favored by
scientific enthusiasm. "Let us take," they say, "the upright and
conscientious ground of refusing all compromise with sin and evil,
and maintaining our position unflinchingly, leave the rest to
God."<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
This is almost precisely the ground taken by the Prohibitionists in
national politics; it is the only ground one can occupy, provided
the taking of a glass of wine, or the performance of any
experiment,&mdash;painless or otherwise,&mdash;is of itself an "evil and
a sin." There are those, however, who believe it possible to oppose and
restrain intemperance by other methods than legislative prohibition.
So with the prohibition of vivisection. Admitting the abuses of the
practice, I cannot yet see that they are so intrinsic and essential as
to make necessary the entire abolition of all physiological
experiments whatsoever.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
II. We may advocate (and I believe we should advocate)&mdash;<i>the total
abolition, by law, of all mutilating or destructive experiments upon
lower animals, involving pain, when such experiments are made for the
purpose of public or private demonstration of already known and
accepted physiological facts</i>.</p>

<p>This is the ground of compromise&mdash;unacceptable, as yet, to either
party. Nevertheless it is asking simply for those limitations and
restrictions which have always been conceded as prudent and fair by
the medical profession of Great Britain. Speaking of a certain
experiment upon the spinal nerves, Dr. M. Foster, of Cambridge
University, one of the leading physiological teachers of England,
says: "I have not performed it and have never seen it done," partly
because of horror at the pain necessary. And yet this experiment has
been performed before classes of young men and young women in the
Medical Schools of this country! Absolutely no legal restriction here
exists to the repetition, over and over again, of the most atrocious
tortures of Mantegazza, Bert and Schiff.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This is the vivisection which does not "pay,"&mdash;even if we
dismiss altogether from our calculation the interests of the animals
sacrificed to the demand for mnemonic aid. For the great and perilous
outcome of such methods will be&mdash;finally&mdash;an atrophy of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
sense of sympathy for human suffering. It is seen to-day in certain
hospitals in Europe. Can other result be expected to follow the deliberate
infliction of prolonged pain without other object than to see or
demonstrate what will happen therefrom? Will any assistance to memory,
counterweigh the annihilation or benumbing of the instinct of pity?</p>

<p>Upon this subject of utility of painful experiments in class
demonstrations or private study, I would like to appeal for judgment
to the physician of the future, who then shall review the experience
of the medical student of to-day. In his course of physiological
training, he or she may be invited to see living animals cut and
mutilated in various ways, eviscerated, poisoned, frozen, starved, and
by ingenious devices of science subjected to the exhibition of pain.
On the first occasion such a scene generally induces in the young man
or young woman a significant subjective phenomenon of physiological
interest; an involuntary, creeping, tremulous sense of horror emerges
into consciousness,&mdash;and is speedily repressed. "This feeling," he
whispers to himself, "is altogether unworthy the scientific spirit in
which I am now to be educated; it needs to be subdued. The sight of
this inarticulate agony, this prolonged anguish is not presented to me
for amusement. I must steel myself to witness it, to assist in it, for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
sake of the good I shall be helped thereby to accomplish, some
day, for suffering humanity."</p>

<p>Praiseworthy sentiments, these are, indeed. Are
they founded in reality? No. The student who
thus conquers "squeamishness" will not see one fact
thus demonstrated at the cost of pain which was unknown
to science before; not one fact which he
might not have been made to remember without this
demonstrative illustration; <i>not one fact</i>&mdash;saddest truth
of all&mdash;that is likely to be of the slightest practical
service to him or to her in the multiplied and various
duties of future professional life. Why, then, are
they shown? To help him to remember his lesson!
Admit the value to the student, but what of the cost?</p>

<p>In one of the great cities of China, I was shown, leaning against the
high wall of the execution ground, a rude, wooden frame-work or cross, old,
hacked, and smeared with recent blood-stains. It was used, I was told, in
the punishment of extreme offenses; the criminal being bound thereto, and
flayed and cut in every way human ingenuity could devise for inflicting
torture before giving an immediately mortal wound. Only the week before,
such an execution had taken place; the victim being a woman who had
poisoned her husband. A young and enthusiastic physician whom I met,
told me he had secured the privilege of being an eye witness to the awful
tragedy, that he might verify a theory he had formed on the influence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
of pain; a theory perhaps like that which led to Mantegazza's crucifixion of pregnant rabbits with
<i>dolori atrocissimi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Science here caught her profit from the punishment of crime, but the
gain would have been the same had her interest alone been the object.
There is <i>always</i> gain, always some aid to memory;&mdash;<i>but what
of the cost?</i></p>

<p>It cannot be expected that any Medical College, of its own accord and
without outside pressure, will restrict or hamper its freedom of
action. As a condition of prosperity and success it cannot show less
than is exhibited by other medical schools; it must keep abreast of
"advanced thought," and do and demonstrate in every way what its
rivals demonstrate and do. There can be no question but that there is
to-day a strong public demand for continental methods of physiological
instruction. Who make this demand? You, gentlemen, students of
medicine, and they who follow in your pathway. This year it is you
who silently request this aid to your memory of the physiological
statements of your text books; another year, another class of young
men and young women, occupying the same benches, or filling the same
laboratory, repeats the demand for the same series of illustrations.
You, perhaps, will have gone forward to take your places in active
life, to assume the real burdens of the medical profession. To those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
succeeding years of thought, reflection and usefulness, let me
appeal, respecting the absolute necessity of all class demonstrations
and laboratory work involving pain. Postpone if you please, the ready
decision which, fresh from your class-room, you are perhaps only too
willing to give me to-day; I do not wish it. But some time in the
future, after years have gone by, remembering all you have seen and
aided in the doing, tell us if you can, exactly wherein you received,
in added potency for helping human suffering and for the treatment of
human ills, the equivalent of that awful expenditure of pain which you
are now demanding, and which by unprotesting acquiescence, you are
<i>to-day</i> helping to inflict.</p>

<h2>DOES VIVISECTION PAY?</h2>


<p>The question of vivisection is again pushing itself to the front. A
distinguished American physiologist has lately come forward in defense
of the French experimenter, Magendie, and, parenthetically, of his
methods of investigation in the study of vital phenomena. On the other
hand, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals made an
unsuccessful attempt, in the New York Legislature last winter, to
secure the passage of a law which would entirely abolish the practice
as now in vogue in our medical schools, or cause it to be secretly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
carried on, in defiance of legal enactments. In support of this bill
it was claimed that physiologists, for the sake of "demonstrating to
medical students certain physiological phenomena connected with the
functions of life, are constantly and habitually in the practice of
cutting up alive, torturing and tormenting divers of the unoffending
brute creation to illustrate their theories and lectures, but without
any practical or beneficial result either to themselves or to the
students, which practice is demoralizing to both and engenders in the
future medical practitioners a want of humanity and sympathy for
physical pain and suffering." How far these statements are true will
be hereafter discussed; but one assertion is so evidently erroneous
that it may be at once indicated. <i>No</i> experiment, however
atrocious, cruel and, therefore, on the whole, unjustifiable, if
performed to illustrate some scientific point, was ever without
"any beneficial result." The benefit may have been infinitesimal,
but every scientific fact is of some value. To assert the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
contrary is to weaken one's case by overstatement.</p>

<p>Leaving out the brute creation, there are three parties interested in
this discussion. In the first place, there are the professors and
teachers of physiology in the medical colleges. Naturally, these
desire no interference with either their work or their methods. They
claim that were the knowledge acquired by experiments upon living
organisms swept out of existence, in many respects the science of
physiology would be little more than guesswork to-day. The subject of
vivisection, they declare, is one which does not concern the general
public, but belongs exclusively to scientists and especially to
physiologists. That the present century should permit sentimentalists
to interfere with scientific investigations is preposterous.</p>

<p>Behind these stand the majority of men belonging to the medical
profession. Holding, as they do, the most important and intimate relations
to society, it is manifestly desirable that they should enjoy the best
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
facilities for the acquirement of knowledge necessary
to their art. To most, the question is merely one of professional
privilege against sentiment, and they cannot hesitate which side to
prefer. In this, as in other professions or trades, the feeling of
<i>esprit de corps</i> is exceedingly strong; and no class of men likes
interference on the part of outsiders. To most physicians it is wholly
a scientific question. It is a matter, they think, with which the
public has no concern; if society can trust to the profession its sick
and dying, they surely can leave to its feeling of humanity a few
worthless brutes.</p>

<p>The opinion of the general public is therefore, divided and confused.
On the one hand, it is profoundly desirous to make systematic and
needless cruelty impossible; yet, on the other, it cannot but hesitate
to take any step which shall hinder medical education, impede scientific
discovery, or restrict search for new methods of treating disease. What
are the sufferings of an animal, however acute or prolonged, compared
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
with the gain to humanity which would result from the knowledge
thereby acquired of a single curative agent? Public opinion hesitates.
A leading newspaper, commenting on the introduction of the Bergh bill,
doubtless expressed the sentiment of most people when it deprecated
prevention of experiments "by which original investigators seek to
establish or verify conclusions which may be of priceless value to the
preservation of life and health among human beings."</p>

<p>The question nevertheless confronts society,&mdash;and in such shape,
too, that society cannot escape, even if it would, the responsibility
of a decision. Either by action or inaction the State must decide
whether the practice of vivisection shall be wholly abolished,
as desired by some; whether it shall be restricted by law
within certain limits and for certain definite objects, as in
Great Britain; or whether we are to continue in this country
to follow the example of France and Germany, in permitting the
practice of physiological experimentation to any extent devised
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
or desired by the experimentalist himself. Any information tending to
indicate which of these courses is best cannot be inopportune. Having
witnessed experiments by some of the most distinguished European
physiologists, such as Claude Bernard (the successor of Magendie),
Milne-Edwards and Brown-Sequard; and, still better (or worse, as the
reader may think), having performed some experiments in this direction
for purposes of investigation and for the instruction of others, the
present writer believes himself justified in holding and stating a
pronounced opinion on this subject, even if it be to some extent,
opposed to the one prevailing in the profession. Suppose, therefore,
we review briefly the arguments to be adduced both in favor of the
practice and against it.</p>

<p>Two principal arguments may be advanced in its favor.</p>

<p>I. It is undeniable that to the practice of vivisection we are
indebted for very much of our present knowledge of physiology.
This is the fortress of the advocates of vivisection,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and a certain refuge when other arguments are of no avail.</p>

<p>II. As a means of teaching physiological facts, vivisection is
unsurpassed. No teacher of science needs to be told the vast
superiority of demonstration over affirmation. Take for instance, the
circulation of the blood. The student who displays but a languid
interest in statements of fact, or even in the best delineations and
charts obtainable, will be thoroughly aroused by seeing the process
actually before his eyes. A week's study upon the book will less
certainly be retained in his memory than a single view of the opened
thorax of a frog or dog. There before him is the throbbing heart; he
sees its relations to adjoining structures, and marks, with a wonder
he never before knew, that mystery of life by which the heart, even
though excised from the body, does not cease for a time its rhythmic
beat. To imagine, then, that teachers of physiology find mere amusement
in these operations is the greatest of ignorant mistakes. They deem it desirable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
that certain facts be accurately fixed in memory, and they know that
no system of mnemonics equals for such purpose the demonstration of
the function itself.</p>

<p>Just here, however, arises a very important question. Admitting the
benefit of the demonstration of scientific facts, <i>how far may one
justifiably subject an animal to pain for the purpose of illustrating
a point already known</i>? It is merely a question of cost. For instance,
it is an undisputed statement in physical science that the diamond is
nothing more than a form of crystallized carbon, and, like other forms
of carbon, under certain conditions, may be made to burn. Now most of
us are entirely willing to accept this, as we do the majority of
truths, upon the testimony of scientific men, without making
demonstration a requisite of assent. In a certain private school,
however, it has long been the custom once a year, to burn in oxygen a
small diamond, worth perhaps $30, so as actually to prove to the
pupils the assertion of their text-books. The experiment is a brilliant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
one; no one can doubt its entire success. Nevertheless, we do not
furnish diamonds to our public schools for this purpose. Exactly
similar to this is one aspect of vivisection&mdash;it is a question of
cost. Granting all the advantages which follow demonstration of
certain physiological facts, the cost is pain&mdash;pain sometimes
amounting to prolonged and excruciating torture. Is the gain worth
this?</p>

<p>Let me mention an instance. Not long ago, in a certain medical college
in the State of New York, I saw what Doctor Sharpey, for thirty years
the professor of physiology in the University Medical College, London,
once characterized by antithesis as "Magendie's <i>infamous</i>
experiment," it having been first performed by that eminent
physiologist. It was designed to prove that the stomach, although
supplied with muscular coats, is during the act of vomiting for the
most part passive; and that expulsion of its contents is due to the
action of the diaphragm and the larger abdominal muscles.
The professor to whom I refer did not propose to have even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Magendie's word accepted as an authority on the subject: the fact
should be demonstrated again. So an incision in the abdomen of a dog
was made; its stomach was cut out; a pig's bladder containing colored
water was inserted in its place, an emetic was injected into the
veins,&mdash;and vomiting ensued. Long before the conclusion of the
experiment the animal became conscious, and its cries of suffering
were exceedingly painful to hear. Now, granting that this experiment
impressed an abstract scientific fact upon the memories of all who saw
it, nevertheless it remains significantly true that the fact thus
demonstrated had no conceivable relation to the treatment of disease.
It is not to-day regarded as conclusive of the theory which, after nearly
two hundred repetitions of his experiment, was doubtless considered by
Magendie as established beyond question. Doctor Sharpey, a strong advocate
of vivisection, by the way, condemned it as a perfectly unjustifiable
experiment, since "besides its atrocity, it was really purposeless."  Was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
this repetition of the experiment which I have described worth its
cost? Was the gain worth the pain?</p>

<p>Let me instance another and more recent case. Being in Paris a year
ago, I went one morning to the College de France, to hear
Brown-Sequard, the most eminent experimenter in vivisection now
living&mdash;one who, Doctor Carpenter tells us, has probably
inflicted more animal suffering than any other man in his time. The
lecturer stated that injury to certain nervous centers near the base
of the brain would produce peculiar and curious phenomena in the
animal operated upon, causing it, for example, to keep turning to one
side in a circular manner, instead of walking in a straightforward
direction. A Guinea-pig was produced&mdash;a little creature, about
the size of a half-grown kitten&mdash;and the operation was effected,
accompanied by a series of piercing little squeaks. As foretold, the
creature thus injured did immediately perform a "circular" movement.
A rabbit was then operated upon with similar results.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Lastly, an unfortunate poodle was introduced, its muzzle tied with
stout whip-cord, wound round and round so tightly that it must
necessarily have caused severe pain. It was forced to walk back and
forth on the long table, during which it cast looks on every side, as
though seeking a possible avenue of escape. Being fastened in the
operating trough, an incision was made to the bone, flaps turned back,
an opening made in the skull, and enlarged by breaking away some
portions with forceps. During these various processes no attempt
whatever was made to cause unconsciousness by means of
an&aelig;sthetics, and the half-articulate, half-smothered cries of
the creature in its agony were terrible to hear, even to one not
unaccustomed to vivisections. The experiment was a "success"; the
animal after its mutilation <i>did</i> describe certain circular movements.
But I cannot help questioning in regard to these demonstrations,
<i>did they pay</i>? This experiment had not the slightest relation
whatever to the cure of disease. More than this: it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
teaches us little or nothing in physiology. The most eminent
physiologist in this country, Doctor Austin Flint, Jr., admits that
experiments of this kind "do not seem to have advanced our positive
knowledge of the functions of the nerve centers," and that similar
experiments "have been very indefinite in their results." On this
occasion, therefore, three animals were subjected to torture to
demonstrate an abstract fact, which probably not a single one of the
two dozen spectators would have hesitated to take for granted on the
word of so great a pathologist as Doctor Brown-Sequard. Was the gain
worth the cost?</p>

<p>This, then, is the great question that must eventually be decided by
the public. Do humanity and science here indicate diverging roads? On
the contrary, I believe it to be an undeniable fact that <i>the highest
scientific and medical opinion is against the repetition of painful
experiments for class teaching</i>. In 1875, a Royal Commission was
appointed in Great Britain to investigate the subject of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
vivisection, with a view to subsequent legislation. The interests of
science were represented by the appointment of Professor Huxley as a
member of this commission. Its meetings continued over several months,
and the report constitutes a large volume of valuable testimony. The
opinions of many of these witnesses are worthy of special attention,
from the eminent position to the men who hold them. The physician to
the Queen, Sir Thomas Watson, with whose "Lectures on Physic" every
medical practitioner in this country is familiar, says: "I hold that
no teacher or man of science who by his own previous experiments, * *
* has thoroughly satisfied himself of the solution of any
physiological problem, is justified in repeating the experiments,
however mercifully, to appease the natural curiosity of a class of
students or of scientific friends." Sir George Burroughs, President of
the Royal College of Physicians, says: "I do not think that an experiment
should be repeated over and over again in our medical schools to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
illustrate what is already established."<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Sir James Paget, Surgeon Extraordinary to the Queen, said before the
commission that "experiments for the purpose of repeating anything
already ascertained ought never to be shown to classes." [363.] Sir
William Fergusson, F. R. S., also Surgeon to her Majesty, asserted
that "sufferings incidental to such operations are protracted in a
very shocking manner"; that of such experiments there is "useless
repetition," and that "when once a fact which involves cruelty to
animals has been fairly recognized and accepted, there is no necessity
for a continued repetition." [1019.] Even physiologists&mdash;some of them
practical experimenters in vivisection&mdash;join in condemning these class
demonstrations. Dr. William Sharpey, before referred to as a teacher of
physiology for over thirty years in University College, says: "Once such facts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
fully established, I do not think it justifiable to repeat experiments
causing pain to animals." [405.] Dr. Rolleston, Professor of
Physiology at Oxford, said that "for class demonstrations limitations
should undoubtedly be imposed, and <i>those limitations should render
illegal painful experiments before classes</i>." [1291.] Charles Darwin,
the greatest of living naturalists, stated that he had never either
directly or indirectly experimented on animals, and that he regarded a
painful experiment without an&aelig;sthetics which might be made with
an&aelig;sthetics as deserving "detestation and abhorrence." [4672.]
And finally the report of this commission, to which is attached the
name of Professor Huxley, says: "With respect to medical schools, we
accept the resolution of the British Association in 1871, that
experimentation without the use of an&aelig;sthetics is not a fitting
exhibition for teaching purposes."</p>

<p>It must be noted that hardly any of these opinions touch the question
of vivisection so far as it is done without the infliction of pain,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
nor object to it as a method of original research; they relate simply
to the practice of repeating painful experiments for purposes of
physiological teaching. We cannot dismiss them as "sentimental" or
unimportant. If painful experiments are necessary for the education of
the young physician, how happens it that Watson and Burroughs are
ignorant of the fact? If indispensable to the proper training of the
surgeon, why are they condemned by Fergusson and Paget? If requisite
even to physiology, why denounced by the physiologists of Oxford and
London? If necessary to science, why viewed "with abhorrence" by the
greatest of modern scientists?</p>

<p>Another objection to vivisection, when practiced as at present without
supervision or control, is the undeniable fact that habitual
familiarity with the infliction of pain upon animals has a decided
tendency to engender a sort of careless indifference regarding
suffering. "Vivisection," says Professor Rolleston of Oxford, "is very
liable to abuse. * * * It is specially liable to tempt a man into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
certain carelessness; the passive impressions produced by the sight of
suffering growing weaker, while the habit and pleasure of experimenting
grows stronger by repetition." [1287.] Says Doctor Elliotson: "I cannot
refrain from expressing my horror at the amount of torture which Doctor
Brachet inflicted. <i>I hardly think knowledge is worth having at such a
purchase.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
A very striking example of this tendency was brought out in the
testimony of a witness before the Royal Commission,&mdash;Doctor
Klein, a practical physiologist. He admitted frankly that as an
investigator he held as entirely indifferent the sufferings of animals
subjected to his experiments, that, except for teaching purposes, he
never used an&aelig;sthetics unless necessary for his own convenience.
Some members of the Commission could hardly realize the possibility of
such a confession.</p>

<p>"Do you mean you have no regard at all to the sufferings of the lower
animals?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
"<i>No regard at all</i>," was the strange reply; and, after a little
further questioning, the witness explained:</p>

<p>"I think that, with regard to an experimenter&mdash;a man who conducts
special research and performs an experiment&mdash;he has <i>no time, so
to speak, for thinking what the animal will feel or suffer</i>!"</p>

<p>Of Magendie's cruel disposition there seems only too abundant
evidence. Says Doctor Elliotson: "Dr. Magendie, in one of his
barbarous experiments, which I am ashamed to say I witnessed, began by
coolly cutting out a large round piece from the back of a beautiful
little puppy, as he would from an apple dumpling!" "It is not to be
doubted that inhumanity may be found in persons of very high position
as physiologists. <i>We have seen that it was so in Magendie.</i>" This is
the language of the report on vivisection, to which is attached the
name of Professor Huxley.</p>

<p>But the fact which, in my own mind, constitutes by far the strongest objection to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
unrestrained experiments in pain, is their questionable utility as
regards therapeutics. Probably most readers are aware that physiology
is that science which treats of the various functions of life, such as
digestion, respiration and the circulation of the blood, while
therapeutics is that department of medicine which relates to the
discovery and application of remedies for disease. Now I venture to
assert that, during the last quarter of a century, infliction of
intense torture upon unknown myriads of sentient, living creatures,
<i>has not resulted in the discovery of a single remedy of acknowledged
and generally accepted value in the cure of disease</i>. This is not
known to the general public, but it is a fact essential to any just
decision regarding the expediency of unrestrained liberty of vivisection.
It is by no means intended to deny the value to therapeutics of well-known
physiological facts acquired thus in the past&mdash;such, for instance,
as the more complete knowledge we possess regarding the circulation of
the blood, or the distinction between motor and sensory nerves,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
nor can original investigation be pronounced absolutely valueless as
respects remote possibility of future gain. What the public has a
right to ask of those who would indefinitely prolong these experiments
without State supervision or control is, "What good have your painful
experiments accomplished during the past thirty years&mdash;not in
ascertaining facts in physiology or causes of rare or incurable
complaints, but in the discovery of improved methods for ameliorating
human suffering, and for the cure of disease?" If pain could be
estimated in money, no corporation ever existed which would be
satisfied with such waste of capital in experiments so futile; no
mining company would permit a quarter-century of "prospecting" in such
barren regions. The usual answer to this inquiry is to bring forward
facts in physiology thus acquired in the past, in place of facts in
therapeutics. Thus, in a recent article on Magendie to which
reference has been made, we are furnished with a long list of
such additions to our knowledge. It may be questioned,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
however, whether the writer is quite scientifically accurate in
asserting that, were our past experience in vivisection abolished, "it
would blot out <i>all</i> that we know to-day in regard to the circulation
of the blood, * * the growth and regeneration of bone, * * * the
origin of many parasitic diseases, * * * the communicability of
certain contagious and infectious diseases, and, to make the list
complete, it would be requisite * * to take <i>a wide range in addition
through the domains of pathology and therapeutics</i>." Surely somewhat
about these subjects has been acquired otherwise than by experiments
upon animals? For example, an inquiring critic might wish to know a
few of the "many parasitic diseases" thus discovered; or what
contagious and infectious diseases, whose communicability was
previously unknown, have had this quality demonstrated solely by
experiments on animals? And what, too, prevented that "wide range
into therapeutics" necessary to make complete the list of benefits
due to vivisection? In urging the utility of a practice
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
so fraught with danger, the utmost precaution against the slightest error of
overstatement becomes an imperative duty. Even so distinguished a
scientist as Sir John Lubbock once rashly asserted in Parliament that,
"without experiments on living animals, we should never have had the
use of ether"! Nearly every American school-boy knows that the
contrary is true&mdash;that the use of ether as an an&aelig;sthetic&mdash;the grandest
discovery of modern times&mdash;had no origin in the torture of animals.</p>

<p>I confess that, until very recently, I shared the common impression
regarding the utility of vivisection in therapeutics. It is a belief
still widely prevalent in the medical profession. Nevertheless, is it
not a mistake? The therapeutical results of nearly half a century of
painful experiments&mdash;we seek them in vain. Do we ask surgery? Sir
William Ferguson, surgeon to the Queen, tells us: "In surgery I am not
aware of any of these experiments on the lower animals having led to
the mitigation of pain or to improvement as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
regards surgical details." [1049.] Have antidotes to poisons been
discovered thereby? Says Doctor Taylor, lecturer on Toxicology for
nearly half a century in the chief London Medical School (a writer
whose work on Poisons is a recognized authority): "I do not know that
we have as yet learned anything, so far as treatment is concerned,
from our experiments with them (<i>i.e.</i> poisons) on animals." [1204.]
Doctor Anthony, speaking of Magendie's experiments, says: "I never
gained one single fact by seeing these cruel experiments in Paris. <i>I
know nothing more from them than I could have read.</i>" [2450.] Even
physiologists admit the paucity of therapeutic results. Doctor Sharpey
says: "I should lay less stress on the direct application of the results of
vivisection to improvement in the art of healing, than upon the value of
these experiments in the promotion of physiology." [394.] The Oxford
professor of Physiology admitted that Etiology, the science which treats
of the causes of disease, had, by these experiments, been the gainer, rather
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
than therapeutics. [1302.] "Experiments on animals," says Doctor
Thorowgood, "already extensive and numerous, cannot be said to
have advanced therapeutics much."<a name="FNanchor_A_5" id="FNanchor_A_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Sir William Gull, M. D., was questioned before the commission whether
he could enumerate any therapeutic remedies which have been discovered
by vivisection, and he replied with fervor: "The cases bristle around
us everywhere!" Yet, excepting Hall's experiments on the nervous
system, he could enumerate only various forms of disease, our
knowledge of which is due to Harvey's discovery, two hundred and fifty
years ago! The question was pushed closer, and so brought to the
necessity of a definite reply, he answered: "I do not say at present
our therapeutics are much, but there are lines of experiment which
<i>seem to promise</i> great help in therapeutics." [5529.] The results of
two centuries of experiments, so far as therapeutics are concerned,
reduced to a seeming promise!</p>

<p>On two points, then, the evidence of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
highest scientific authorities in Great Britain seems
conclusive&mdash;first, that experiments upon living animals conduce
chiefly to the benefit of the science of physiology, and little, if at
all, at the present day, to the treatment of disease or the
amelioration of human suffering; and, secondly, that repetition of
painful experiments for class-teaching in medical schools is both
unnecessary and unjustifiable. Do these conclusions affect the
practice of vivisection in this country? Is it true that experiments
are habitually performed in some of our medical schools, often causing
extreme pain, to illustrate well-known and accepted
facts&mdash;experiments which English physiologists pronounce
"infamous" and "atrocious," which English physicians and surgeons
stigmatize as purposeless cruelty and unjustifiable&mdash;which even
Huxley regards as unfitting for teaching purposes, and Darwin
denounces as worthy of detestation and abhorrence? I confess I see no
occasion for any over-delicate reticence in this matter.
Science needs no secrecy either for her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
methods or results; her function is to reveal, not to hide, facts. The
reply to these questions must be in the affirmative. In this country
our physiologists are rather followers of Magendie and Bernard, after
the methods in vogue at Paris and Leipsic, than governed by the
cautious and sensitive conservatism in this respect which generally
characterizes the physiological teaching of London and Oxford. In
making this statement, no criticism is intended on the motives of
those responsible for ingrafting continental methods upon our medical
schools. If any opprobrium shall be inferred for the past performance
of experiments herein condemned, the present writer asks a share in
it. It is the future that we hope to change. Now, what are the facts?
A recent contributor to the "International Review," referring to Mr.
Bergh, says that "he assails physiological experiments with the same
blind extravagance of denunciation as if they were still performed
without an&aelig;sthetics, as in the time of Magendie."
In the interests of scientific accuracy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
one would wish more care had been given to the construction of this
sentence, for it implies that experiments are not now performed except
with an&aelig;sthetics&mdash;a meaning its author never could have
intended to convey. Every medical student in New York knows that
experiments involving pain are repeatedly performed to illustrate
teaching. It is no secret; one need not go beyond the frank admissions
of our later text-books on physiology for abundant proof, not only of
this, but of the extent to which experimentation is now carried in
this country. "We have long been in the habit, in class demonstrations,
of removing the optic lobe on one side from a pigeon," says Professor
Flint, of Bellevue Hospital Medical College, in his excellent work on
Physiology.<a name="FNanchor_A_6" id="FNanchor_A_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
"The experiment of dividing the sympathetic in the neck, especially
in rabbits, is so easily performed that the phenomena observed
by Bernard and Brown-Sequard have been repeatedly verified.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
<i>We have often done this in class
demonstrations.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_A_7" id="FNanchor_A_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
"The cerebral lobes were removed from a young pigeon in the usual
way, an operation * * <i>which we practice yearly as a class
demonstration</i>."<a name="FNanchor_B_8" id="FNanchor_B_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Referring to the removal of the cerebellum, the same authority states:
"Our own experiments, which have been very numerous during the last
fifteen years, are <i>simply repetitions of those of Flourens, and the
results have been the same without exception."</i><a name="FNanchor_C_9" id="FNanchor_C_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
<i>We have frequently removed both kidneys</i> from dogs, and when the
operation is carefully performed the animals live for from three to
five days. * * Death always takes place with symptoms of blood
poisoning."<a name="FNanchor_D_10" id="FNanchor_D_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
In the same work we are given precise details for making a pancreatic
fistula, after the method of Claude Bernard&mdash;"one we have
repeatedly employed with success." "In performing the above experiment
it is generally better <i>not</i> to employ an
an&aelig;sthetic,"<a name="FNanchor_E_11" id="FNanchor_E_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
but ether is sometimes used. In the same work
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
is given a picture of a dog, muzzled and with a biliary fistula, as it
appeared the fourteenth day after the operation, which, with details
of the experiment, is quite suggestive.<a name="FNanchor_F_12" id="FNanchor_F_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Bernard was the first to succeed in following the spinal accessory
nerve back to the jugular foramen, seizing it here with a strong pair
of forceps and drawing it out by the roots. This experiment is
practiced in our own country. "We have found this result (loss of
voice) to follow in the cat after the spinal accessory nerves have
been torn out by the roots," says Professor John C. Dalton, in his
Treatise on Human Physiology.<a name="FNanchor_G_13" id="FNanchor_G_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
"This operation is difficult," writes Professor Flint, "but we have
several times performed it with entire success;" and his assistant
at Bellevue Medical College has succeeded "in extirpating these nerves
for class demonstrations."<a name="FNanchor_H_14" id="FNanchor_H_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
In withdrawal of blood from the hepatic veins of a dog, "avoiding
the administration of an an&aelig;sthetic" is one of the steps
recommended.<a name="FNanchor_I_15" id="FNanchor_I_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
The curious experiment of Bernard,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
in which artificial diabetes is produced by irritating the floor of
the fourth ventricle of the brain, is carefully described, and
illustrations afforded both of the instrument and the animal
undergoing the operation. The inexperienced experimenter is here
taught to hold the head of the rabbit "firmly in the left hand," and
to bore through its skull "by a few lateral movements of the
instrument." It is not a difficult operation; it is one which the
author has "often repeated." He tell us "<i>it is not desirable to
administer an an&aelig;sthetic</i>," as it would prevent success; and a
little further we are told that "we should avoid the administration of
an&aelig;sthetics in all accurate experiments on the glycogenic
function."<a name="FNanchor_J_16" id="FNanchor_J_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
It is true the pleasing assurance is given that "this experiment is
almost painless"; but on this point, could the rabbit speak during the
operation, its opinion might not accord with that of the physiologist.</p>

<p>There is one experiment in regard to which the severe characterization of English
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
scientists is especially applicable, from the pain necessarily
attending it. Numerous investigators have long established the fact
that the great sensory nerve of the head and face is endowed with an
exquisite degree of sensibility. More than half a century ago, both
Magendie and Sir Charles Bell pointed out that merely exposing and
touching this fifth nerve gave signs of most acute pain. "All who have
divided this root in living animals must have recognized, not only
that it is sensitive, but that its sensibility is far more acute than
that of any other nervous trunk in the
body."<a name="FNanchor_A_17" id="FNanchor_A_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
"The fifth pair," says Professor John C. Dalton, "is the most acutely
sensitive nerve in the whole body. Its irritation by mechanical means
<i>always causes intense pain</i>, and even though the animal be
nearly unconscious from the influence of ether, any severe injury
to its large root is almost invariably followed by
cries."<a name="FNanchor_B_18" id="FNanchor_B_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Testimony on this point is uniform and abundant. If
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
science speaks anywhere with assurance, it is in regard to the
properties of this nerve. Yet every year the experiment is repeated
before medical classes, simply to demonstrate accepted facts. "This is
an operation," says Professor Flint, referring to the division of this
nerve, "that we have frequently performed with success." He adds that
"it is difficult from the fact that one is working in the dark, and it
requires a certain amount of dexterity, <i>to be acquired only by
practice</i>." Minute directions are therefore laid down for the
operative procedure, and illustrations given both of the instrument to
be used, and of the head of a rabbit with the blade of the instrument in
its cranial cavity.<a name="FNanchor_C_19" id="FNanchor_C_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Holding the head of our rabbit firmly in the left hand, we are
directed to penetrate the cranium in a particular manner. "Soon the
operator feels at a certain depth that the bony resistance ceases; he
is then on the fifth pair, and the cries of the animal give
evidence that the nerve is pressed upon." This is one of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Magendie's celebrated experiments; perhaps the reader fancies that in
its modern repetitions the animal suffers nothing, being rendered
insensible by an&aelig;sthetics? "<i>It is much more satisfactory to
divide the nerve without etherizing the animal, as the evidence of
pain is an important guide in this delicate operation.</i>"
An&aelig;sthetics, however, are sometimes used, but not so as wholly
to overcome the pain.</p>

<p>Testimony of individuals, indicating the extent to which vivisection
is at present practiced in this country might be given; but it seems
better to submit proof within the reach of every reader, and the
accuracy of which is beyond cavil. No legal restrictions whatever
exist, preventing the performance of any experiment desired. Indeed, I
think it may safely be asserted that, in the city of New York, in a
single medical school, more pain is inflicted upon living animals as a
means of teaching well-known facts, than is permitted to be done for
the same purpose in all the medical schools of Great Britain and Ireland.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
And <i>cui bono</i>? "I can truly say," writes a physician who has seen all
these experiments, "that not only have I never seen any results at all
commensurate with the suffering inflicted, but I cannot recall a
single experiment which, in the slightest degree, has increased my
ability to relieve pain, or in any way fitted me to cope better with
disease."</p>

<p>In respect to this practice, therefore, evidence abounds indicating
the necessity for that State supervision which obtains in Great
Britain. We cannot abolish it any more than we can repress dissection;
to attempt it would be equally unwise. Within certain limitations,
dictated both by a regard for the interest of science and by that
sympathy for everything that lives and suffers which is the highest
attribute of humanity, it seems to me that the practice of vivisection
should be allowed. What are these restrictions?</p>

<p>The following conclusions are suggested as a basis for future
legislation:</p>

<p><i>I. Any experiment or operation whatever upon a living animal, during which by</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
<i>recognized an&aelig;sthetics it is made completely insensible
to pain, should be permitted.</i></p>

<p>This does not necessarily imply the taking of life. Should a surgeon,
for example, desire to cause a fracture or tie an artery, and then
permit the animal to recover so as to note subsequent effects, there
is no reason why the privilege should be refused. The discomfort
following such an operation would be inconsiderable. This permission
should not extend to experiments purely physiological and having no
definite relation to surgery; nor to mutilation from which recovery is
impossible, and prolonged pain certain as a sequence.</p>

<p><i>II. Any experiment performed thus, under complete an&aelig;sthesia,
though involving any degree of mutilation, if concluded by the
extinction of life before consciousness is regained should also be
permitted.</i></p>

<p>To object to killing animals for scientific purposes while we continue
to demand their sacrifice for food, is to seek for the appetite a
privilege we refuse the mind. It is equally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
absurd to object to vivisection because it dissects, or "cuts up." If
no pain be felt, why is it worse to cut up a dog, than a sheep or an
ox? Such experiments as the foregoing might be permitted to any extent
desired in our medical schools.</p>

<p>Far more difficult is the question of painful experimentation.
Unfortunately, it so happens that the most attractive original
investigations are largely upon the nervous system, involving the
consciousness of pain as a requisite to success. Toward this class of
experiments the State should act with caution and firmness. It seems
to me that the following restrictions are only just.</p>

<p><i>III. In view of the great cost in suffering, as compared with the
slight profit gained by the student, the repetition, for purposes of
class instruction of any experiment involving pain to a vertebrate
animal should be forbidden by law.</i></p>

<p><i>IV. In view of the slight gain to practical medicine resulting
from innumerable past experiments of this kind, a painful experiment</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
<i>upon a living vertebrate animal should be permitted solely for
purposes of original investigation, and then only under the most rigid
surveillance, and preceded by the strictest precautions.</i> For every
experiment of this kind the physiologist should be required to obtain
special permission from a State board, specifying on application (1)
the object of the proposed investigation, (2) the nature and method of
the operation, (3) the species of animal to be sacrificed, and (4) the
shortest period during which pain will probably be felt. An officer of
the State should be given an opportunity to be present; and a report
made, both of the length of time occupied, and the knowledge, if any,
gained thereby. If these restrictions are made obligatory by statute,
and their violation made punishable by a heavy fine, such experiments
will be generally performed only when absolutely necessary for
purposes of scientific research.</p>

<p>In few matters is there greater necessity for careful discrimination
than in everything pertaining to this subject. The attempt has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
been made in this paper to indicate how far the State&mdash;leaning to
mercy's side&mdash;may sanction a practice often so necessary and
useful, always so dangerous in its tendencies. That is a worthy ideal
of conduct which seeks</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Never to blend our pleasure or our pride<br />
With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Is not this a sentiment in which even science
may fitly share? Are we justified in neglecting
the evidence she offers, purchased in the past
at such immeasurable agonies, and in demanding
that year after year new victims shall be
subjected to torture, only to demonstrate what
none of us doubt? That is the chief question.
For, if all compromise be persistently rejected
by physiologists, there is danger that some
day, impelled by the advancing growth of
humane sentiment, society may confound in
one common condemnation all experiments
of this nature, and make the whole practice
impossible, except in secret and as a crime.</p>

<h2>VIVISECTION.</h2>


<p>Omitting entirely any consideration of the ethics of vivisection, the
only points to which in the present article the attention of the
reader is invited are those in which scientific inquirers may be
supposed to have a common interest.</p>

<p>I. One danger to which scientific truth seems to be exposed is a
peculiar tendency to underestimate the numberless uncertainties and
contradictions created by experimentation upon living beings. Judging
from the enthusiasm of its advocates, one would think that by this
method of interrogating nature all fallacies can be detected, all
doubts determined. But, on the contrary, the result of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
experimentation, in many directions, is to plunge the observer into
the abyss of uncertainty. Take, for example, one of the simplest and
yet most important questions possible,&mdash;the degree of sensibility
in the lower animals. Has an infinite number of experiments enabled
physiologists to determine for us the mere question of pain? Suppose
an amateur experimenter in London, desirous of performing some severe
operations upon frogs, to hesitate because of the extreme painfulness
of his methods, what replies would he be likely to obtain from the
highest scientific authorities of England as to the sensibility of
these creatures? We may fairly judge their probable answers to such
inquiries from their evidence already given before a royal
commission.<a name="FNanchor_A_20" id="FNanchor_A_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Carpenter would doubtless repeat his opinion that "frogs have
extremely little perception of pain;" and in the evidence of that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
experienced physiologist George Henry Lewes, he would find the
cheerful assurance, "I do not believe that frogs suffer pain at all."
Our friend applies, let us suppose, to Dr. Klein, of St. Bartholomew's
Hospital, who despises the sentimentality which regards animal
suffering as of the least consequence; and this enthusiastic
vivisector informs him that, in his English experience, the experiment
which caused the greatest pain without an&aelig;sthetics was the
cauterization of the cornea of a frog. Somewhat confused at finding
that a most painful experiment can be performed upon an animal that
does not suffer he relates this to Dr. Swaine Taylor, of Guy's
Hospital, who does not think that Klein's experiment would cause
severe suffering; but of another&mdash;placing a frog in cold water
and raising the temperature to about 100&deg;&mdash;"that," says
Doctor Taylor, "would be a cruel experiment: I cannot see what purpose
it can answer." Before leaving Guy's Hospital, our inquiring friend
meets Dr. Pavy, one of the most celebrated physiologists
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
in England, who tells him that in this experiment, stigmatized by his
colleague as "cruel," the frog would in reality suffer very little;
that if we ourselves were treated to a bath gradually raised from a
medium temperature to the boiling point, "I think we should not feel
any pain;" that were we plunged at once into boiling water, "even
then," says the enthusiastic and scientific Dr. Pavy, "I do not think
pain would be experienced!" Our friend goes then to Dr. Sibson, of St.
Mary's Hospital, who as a physiologist of many years' standing, sees
no objection to freezing, starving, or baking animals alive; but he
declares of boiling a frog, "That is a horrible idea, and I certainly
am not going to defend it." Perplexed more than ever, he goes to Dr.
Lister, of King's College, and is astonished upon being told
"that the mere holding of a frog in your warm hand is about as
painful as any experiment probably that you would perform."
Finally, one of the strongest advocates of vivisections,
Dr. Anthony, pupil of Sir Charles Bell, would exclaim, if a mere
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
exposition of the lungs of the frog were referred to, "Fond as I am of
physiology, I would not do that for the world!"</p>

<p>Now, what has our inquirer learned by his appeal to science? Has he
gained any clear and absolute knowledge? Hardly two of the
experimenters named agree upon one simple yet most important
preliminary of research&mdash;<i>the sensibility to pain of a single
species of animals</i>.</p>

<p>Let us interrogate scientific opinion a little further on this
question of sensibility. Is there any difference in animals as regards
susceptibility to pain? Dr. Anthony says that we may take the amount of
intelligence in animals as a fair measure of their sensibility&mdash;that
the pain one would suffer would be in proportion to its intelligence.
Dr. Rutherford, Edinburgh, never performs an experiment upon a cat or
a spaniel if he can help it, because they are so exceedingly
sensitive; and Dr. Horatio Wood, of Philadelphia, tells us that the
nervous system of a cat is far more sensitive than that of the rabbit. On
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
the other hand, Dr. Lister, of King's College, is not aware of any
such difference in sensibility in animals, and Dr. Brunton, of St.
Bartholomew's, finds cats such very good animals to operate with that
he on one occasion used ninety in making a single experiment.</p>

<p>Sir William Gull thinks "there are but few experiments performed on
living creatures where sensation is not removed," yet Dr. Rutherford
admits "about half" his experiments to have been made upon animals
sensitive to pain. Professor Rolleston, of Oxford University, tells us
"the whole question of an&aelig;sthetizing animals has an element of
uncertainty"; and Professor Rutherford declares it "impossible to say"
whether even artificial respiration is painful or not, "unless the
animal can speak." Dr. Brunton, of St. Bartholomew's, says of that
most painful experiment, poisoning by strychnine, that it cannot be
efficiently shown if the animal be under chloroform. Dr. Davy, of
Guy's, on the contrary, always gives chloroform, and finds it no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
impediment to successful demonstration, Is opium an an&aelig;sthetic?
Claude Bernard declares that sensibility exists even though the animal
be motionless: "<i>Il sent la douleur, mais il a, pour ainsi dire, perdu
l'idee de la defense.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_A_21" id="FNanchor_A_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
But Dr. Brunton, of St. Bartholomew's hospital, London, has no
hesitation whatever in contradicting this statement "emphatically,
however high an authority it may be."</p>

<p>Curare, a poison invented by South American Indians for their arrows,
is much used in physiological laboratories to paralyze the motor
nerves, rendering an animal absolutely incapable of the slightest
disturbing movement. Does it at the same time destroy sensation, or is
the creature conscious of every pang? Claude Bernard, of Paris,
Sharpey, of London, and Flint, of New York<a name="FNanchor_B_22" id="FNanchor_B_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
all agree that sensation is <i>not</i> abolished; on the other hand,
Rutherford regards curare as a partial an&aelig;sthetic, and Huxley strongly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
intimates that Bernard in thus deciding from experiments that it does
not affect the cerebral hemispheres or consciousness, "<i>jumped
at a conclusion</i> for which neither he nor anybody else had any
scientific justification." This is extraordinary language for one
experimentalist to use regarding others! If it is possible that such
men as Claude Bernard and Professor Flint have "jumped at" one utterly
unscientific conclusion, notwithstanding the most painstaking of
vivisections, what security have we that other of our theories in
physiology now regarded as absolutely established may not be one day
as severely ridiculed by succeeding investigators? Is it, after all,
true, that the absolute certainty of our most important deductions
must remain forever hidden "unless the animal can speak"?</p>

<p>II. Between advocating State supervision of painful vivisection, and
proposing with Mr. Bergh the total suppression of all experiments,
painful or otherwise, there is manifestly a very wide distinction.
Unfortunately, the suggestion of any interference whatever invariably
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
rouses the anger of those most interested&mdash;an indignation as
unreasonable, to say the least, as that of the merchant who refuses a
receipt for money just paid to him, on the ground that a request for a
written acknowledgement is a reflection upon his honesty. I cannot see
how otherwise than by State supervision we are to reach abuses which
confessedly exist. Can we trust the sensitiveness and conscience of
every experimenter? Nobody claims this. One of the leading
physiologists in this country, Dr. John C. Dalton, admits "that
vivisection may be, and has been, abused by reckless, unfeeling, or
unskillful persons;" that he himself has witnessed abroad, in a veterinary
institution, operations than which "nothing could be more shocking."
And yet the unspeakable atrocities at Alfort, to which, apparently,
Dr. Dalton alludes, were defended upon the very ground he occupies to-day
in advocating experiments of the modern laboratory and classroom; for
the Academie des Sciences decided that there was "no occasion to take any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
notice of complaints; that in the future, as in the past,
vivisectional experiments must be left entirely to the judgment of
scientific men." What seemed "atrocious" to the more tender-hearted
Anglo-Saxon was pronounced entirely justifiable by the French Academy
of Science.</p>

<p>A curious question suggests itself in connection with this point.
There can be little doubt, I think, that the sentiment of compassion
and of sympathy with suffering is more generally diffused among all
classes of Great Britain than elsewhere in Europe; and one cannot help
wondering what our place might be, were it possible to institute any
reliable comparison of national humanity. Should we be found in all
respects as sensitive as the English people? Would indignation and
protest be as quickly and spontaneously evoked among us by a cruel
act? The question may appear an ungracious one, yet it seems to me
there exists some reason why it should be plainly asked. There
is a certain experiment&mdash;one of the most excruciating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
that can be performed&mdash;which consists in exposing the spinal cord
of the dog for the purpose of demonstrating the functions of the
spinal nerves. It is one, by the way, which Dr. Wilder forgot to
enumerate in his summary of the "four kinds of experiments," since it
is not the "cutting operation" which forms its chief peculiarity or to
which special objection would be made. At present all this preliminary
process is generally performed under an&aelig;sthetics: it is an hour
or two later, when the animal has partly recovered from the severe
shock of the operation, that the wound is reopened and the experiment
begins. It was during a class demonstration of this kind by Magendie,
before the introduction of ether, that the circumstance occurred which
one hesitates to think possible in a person retaining a single spark
of humanity or pity. "I recall to mind," says Dr. Latour, who was
present at the time, "a poor dog, the roots of whose
vertebral nerves Magendie desired to lay bare
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to demonstrate Bell's theory, which he claimed as his own. The dog,
mutilated and bleeding twice escaped from under the implacable knife,
and threw its front paws around Magendie's neck, licking, as if to
soften his murderer and ask for mercy! I confess I was unable to
endure that heartrending spectacle."</p>

<p>It was probably in reference to this experiment that Sir Charles Bell,
the greatest English physiologist of our century, writing to his
brother in 1822, informs him that he hesitates to go on with his
investigations. "You may think me silly," he adds, "but I cannot
perfectly convince myself that I am authorized in nature or religion
to do these cruelties." Now, what do English physiologists and
vivisectors of the present day think of the repetition of this
experiment solely as a class demonstration?</p>

<p>They have candidly expressed their opinions before a royal
commission. Dr. David Ferrier, of King's college, noted for
his experiments upon the brain of monkeys, affirms his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
belief that "students would rebel" at the sight of a painful
experiment. Dr. Rutherford, who certainly dared do all that may become
a physiologist, confesses mournfully, "<i>I dare not</i> show an experiment
upon a dog or rabbit before students, when the animal is not
an&aelig;sthetized." Dr. Pavy, of Guy's Hospital, asserts that a
painful experiment introduced before a class "would not be tolerated
for a moment." Sir William Gull, M. D., believes that the repetition
of an operation like this upon the spinal nerves would excite the
reprobation alike of teacher, pupils, and the public at large. Michael
Foster, of Cambridge University, who minutely describes all the
details of the experiment on recurrent sensibility in the "Handbook
for the Physiological Laboratory," nevertheless tells us, "I have not
performed it, and have never seen it done," partly, as he confesses,
"from horror at the pain." And finally Dr. Burdon-Sanderson,
physiologist at University College, London, states with the utmost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
emphasis, in regard to the performance of this demonstration on the
spinal cord, "I am perfectly certain that no physiologist&mdash;none
of the leading men in Germany, for example&mdash;would exhibit an
experiment of that kind."</p>

<p>Now mark the contrast. This experiment&mdash;which we are told passes
even the callousness of Germany to repeat; which every leading
champion of vivisection in Great Britain reprobates for medical
teaching; which some of them shrink even from seeing, themselves, from
horror at the tortures necessarily inflicted; which the most ruthless
among them <i>dare not</i> exhibit to the young men of England,&mdash;<i>this
experiment has been performed publicly again and again in American
medical colleges</i>, without exciting, so far as we know, even a whisper
of protest or the faintest murmur of remonstrance! The proof is to be
found in the published statements of the experimenter himself. In his
"Text-Book of Physiology," Professor Flint says, "Magendie showed very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
satisfactorily that the posterior roots (of the spinal cord) were
exclusively sensory, and this fact has been confirmed by more recent
observations upon the higher classes of animals. We have ourselves
frequently exposed and irritated the roots of the nerves in dogs, <i>in
public demonstrations</i> in experiments on the recurrent sensibility,
... and in another series of observations."<a name="FNanchor_A_23" id="FNanchor_A_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>This is the experience of a single professional teacher; but it is
improbable that this experiment has been shown only to the students of
a single medical college in the United States; it has doubtless been
repeated again and again in different colleges throughout the country.
If Englishmen are, then, so extremely sensitive as Ferrier, Gull, and
Burdon-Sanderson would have us believe, we must necessarily conclude
that the sentiment of compassion is far greater in Britain than in
America. Have we drifted backward in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
humanity? Have American students learned to witness, without protest,
tortures at the sight of which English students would rebel? We are
told that there is no need of any public sensitiveness on this
subject. We should trust entirely, as they do in France,&mdash;at
Alfort, for example,&mdash;"to the judgment of the investigator."
There must be no lifting of the veil to the outside multitude; for the
priests of this unpitying science there must be as absolute immunity
from criticism or inquiry as was ever demanded before the shrine of
Delphi or the altars of Baal. "Let them exercise their solemn office,"
demands Dr. Wilder, "not only unrestrained by law, but upheld by
public sentiment."</p>

<p>For myself, I cannot believe this position is tenable. Nothing seems
to me more certain than the results that must follow if popular
sentiment in this country shall knowingly sustain the public
demonstration of an experiments in pain, which can find no defender
among the physiologists of Great Britain. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
has been my fortune to know something of the large hospitals of
Europe; and I confess I do not know a single one in countries where
painful vivisection flourishes, unchecked by law, wherein the poor and
needy sick are treated with the sympathy, the delicacy, or even the
decency, which so universally characterize the hospitals of England.
When Magendie, operating for cataract, plunged his needle to the
bottom of his patient's eye, that he might note upon a human being the
effect produced by mechanical irritation of the retina, he
demonstrated how greatly the zeal of the enthusiast may impair the
responsibility of the physician and the sympathy of man for man.</p>

<p>III. The utility of vivisection in advancing therapeutics, despite
much argument, still remains an open question. No one is so foolish as
to deny the possibility of future usefulness to any discovery
whatever; but there is a distinction, very easily slurred over
in the eagerness of debate, between present applicability
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
and remotely potential service. If the pains inflicted on animals are
absolutely necessary to the protection of human life and the
advancement of practical skill in medicine, should sentiment be
permitted to check investigation? An English prelate, the Bishop of
Peterborough, speaking in Parliament on this subject, once told the
House of Lords that "it was very difficult to decide what was
unnecessary pain," and as an example of the perplexities which arose
in his own mind he mentioned "the case of the wretched man who was
convicted of skinning cats alive, because their skins were more
valuable when taken from the living animal than from the dead one. The
extra money," added the Bishop, "got the man a dinner!"<a name="FNanchor_A_24" id="FNanchor_A_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Whether in this particular case the excuse was well received by the judge,
the reverend prelate neglected to inform us; but it is certain that the plea
for painful experimentation rests substantially on the same basis. Out of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
agonies of sentient brutes we are to pluck the secret of longer
living and the art of surer triumph over intractable disease.</p>

<p>But has this hope been fulfilled? Pasteur, we are told, has claimed
the discovery of a cure for hydrophobia through experiments on
animals. It may be well worth its cost if only true; but we cannot
forget that its practical value is by no means yet demonstrated. Aside
from this, has physiological experimentation during the last quarter
of a century contributed such marked improvements in therapeutic
methods that we find certain and tangible evidence thereof in the
diminishing fatality of any disease? Can one mention a single malady
which thirty years ago resisted every remedial effort, to which the
more enlightened science of to-day can offer hopes of recovery? These
seem to me perfectly legitimate and fair questions, and, fortunately,
in one respect, capable of a scientific reply. I suppose the opinion
of the late Claude Bernard, of Paris, would be generally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
accepted as that of the highest scientific authority on the utility of
vivisection in "practical medicine;" but he tells us that it is hardly
worth while to make the inquiry. "Without doubt," he confessed, "<i>our
hands are empty to-day</i>, although our mouths are full of legitimate
promises for the future."</p>

<p>Was Claude Bernard correct in this opinion as to the "empty hands?" If
scientific evidence is worth anything, it points to the appalling
conclusion that, <i>notwithstanding all the researches of physiology,
the chief forms of chronic disease exhibit to-day in England a greater
fatality than thirty years ago</i>. In the following table I have
indicated the average annual mortality, per million inhabitants, of
certain diseases, <i>first</i>, for the period of five years from 1850 to
1854, and <i>secondly</i>, for the period twenty-five years later, from
1875 to 1879. The authority is beyond question; the facts are
collected from the report to Parliament of the Registrar-general of
England:</p>

<p>This is certainly a most startling exhibit, when we remember that
from only these few causes about half of <i>all</i> the deaths in
England annually occur, and that from them result the deaths of
two-thirds of the persons, of both sexes, who reach the age of twenty
years.<a name="FNanchor_A_25" id="FNanchor_A_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
What are the effects here discernible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of Bernard's experiments upon diabetes? of Brown-Sequard's upon
epilepsy and paralysis? of Flint's and Pavy's on diseases of the
liver? of Ferrier's researches upon the functions of the brain? Let us
appeal from the heated enthusiasm of the experimenter to the stern
facts of the statistician. Why, so far from having obtained the least
mastery over those malignant forces which seem forever to elude and
baffle our art, they are actually gaining upon us; every one of these
forms of disease is more fatal to-day in England than thirty years
ago; during 1879 over sixty thousand <i>more</i> deaths resulted from these
maladies alone than would have occurred had the rate of mortality from
them been simply that which prevailed during the benighted period of
1850 to 1854! True, during later years there has been a diminished
mortality in England, but it is from the lesser prevalence of zymotic
diseases, which no one to-day pretends to cure; while the organic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
diseases show a constant tendency to increase. Part of this may be due
to more accurate diagnosis and clearer definition of mortality causes:
but this will not explain a phenomenon which is too evident to be
overlooked.</p>

<p>"It is a fact," says the Registrar-general, in his report for 1879,
"that while mortality in early life has been very notably diminished,
<i>the mortality of persons in middle or advanced life has been steadily
rising for a long period of years</i>." It is probable that the same
story would be told by the records of France, Germany, and other
European countries; it is useless, of course, to refer to America,
since in regard to statistical information we still lag behind every
country which pretends to be civilized.<a name="FNanchor_A_26" id="FNanchor_A_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
Undoubtedly it would be a false assumption which from these facts
should deduce retrogression in medical art or deny advance and
improvement; but they certainly indicate that the boasted
superiority of modern medicine over the skill of our fathers,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
due to physiological researches, is not sustained by the only
impartial authority to which science can appeal for evidence of
results.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>What then is the substance of the whole matter? It seems to me the
following conclusions are justified by the facts presented.</p>

<p>I. All experiments upon living animals may be divided into two general
classes; 1st those which produce pain,&mdash;slight, brief, severe or
atrociously acute and prolonged; and 2nd, those experiments which are
performed under complete an&aelig;sthesia from which either death
ensues during unconsciousness, or entire recovery may follow.</p>

<p>II. The majority of vivisections requisite for purposes of teaching
physiological facts <i>may</i> be so carried on as to take life with less
pain or inconvenience to the animal than is absolutely necessary in order
to furnish meat for our tables. Those who would make it a penal offense to
submit to a class of college students the unconscious and painless demonstration
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
of functional activity of the heart, for example, and yet demand for
the gratification of appetite the daily slaughter of oxen and sheep
without an&aelig;sthetics, and without any attempt to minimize the
agony of terror, fear and pain&mdash;may not be inconsistent. But it
is a view the writer cannot share.</p>

<p>III. Prohibition of all experiments may be fairly demanded by those
who believe that the enthusiastic ardor of the scientific experimenter
or lecturer, will outweigh all considerations of good faith, provided
success or failure of his experiment depend on the consciousness of
pain. In other words, that the experimenter himself, as a rule,
<i>cannot be trusted to obey the law, should the law restrict</i>.</p>

<p>This also is an extreme position.</p>

<p>IV. Absolute liberty in the matter of painful experiments has produced
admitted abuses by physiologists of Germany, France and Italy. In
America it has led to the repetition before classes of students of
Magendie's extreme cruelties,&mdash;demonstrations which have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
been condemned by every leading English physiologist.</p>

<p>V. In view of the dangerous impulses not unfrequently awakened by the
sight of pain intentionally inflicted, experiments of this kind should
be by legal enactment absolutely forbidden before classes of students,
especially in our Public Schools.</p>

<p>VI. It is not in accord with scientific accuracy to contend for
unlimited freedom of painful experimentation, on the ground of its
vast utility to humanity in the discovery of new methods for the cure
of disease. On the contrary, so far as can be discovered by a careful
study of English mortality statistics, physiological experiments upon
living animals for fifty years back have in no single instance
lessened the fatality of any disease below its average of thirty-five
years ago.</p>

<p>VII. Vivisection, involving the infliction of pain is, even in its
best possible aspect, a necessary evil, and ought at once to be
restricted within the narrowest limits, and placed under the
supervision of the State.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>For reasons sufficiently stated in the preceding pages, the writer
does not advocate the total abolition of all experimentation. It is
only fair to acknowledge, however, that very strong and weighty
arguments in favor of legal repression have been advanced both in this
country and abroad, some of which are herewith presented, as the other
side of the question.</p>

<p>The cause of abolition has no more earnest and eloquent advocate than
Miss Frances Power Cobbe of England. Through innumerable controversies
with scientific men in the public journals, magazines and reviews, she
has presented in awful array, the abuses of unlimited and uncontrolled
experimentation on the continent of Europe, and the arguments in favor
of total repression. The following letters, extracts from her public
correspondence, will indicate her position.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<h4>TENDER VIVISECTION.<br />
(<span class="smcap">To the Editor of the "Scotsman."</span>)</h4>

<p class="author">1, Victoria Street, London, S. W.,<br />
January 10, 1881. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir.</span>&mdash;An Italian pamphlet, <i>Dell'Azione del Dolore sulla
Respirazione</i> (The Action of Pain on Respiration), has just reached my
hands, and as it is, I think, quite unknown in this country, I will
beg you to grant me space for a few extracts from its pages. The
pamphlet is by the eminent physiologist, Mantegazza, and was published
by Chiusi, of Milan. Having explained the object of his investigations
to be the effects of pain on the respiratory organs, the Professor
describes (p. 20) the methods he devised for the production of such
pain. He found the best to consist in "planting nails, sharp and
numerous, through the feet of the animal in such a manner as to render
the creature almost motionless, because in every movement it would
have felt its torment more acutely" (<i>piantando chiodi acuti e numerosi
attraverso le piante dei piedi in modo da rendere immobile o quasi
l'animale, perch&eacute; ad ogni movimento avrebbe sentito molto piu acuto
il suo tormento</i>). Further on he mentions that, to produce still more
intense pain (<i>dolore intenso</i>) he was obliged to employ lesions,
followed by inflammation. An ingenious machine, constructed by "our"
Tecnomasio, of Milan, enabled him likewise to grip any part of an animal with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
pincers with iron teeth, and to crush, or tear, or lift up the victim,
"so as to produce pain in every possible way." A drawing of this
instrument is appended. The first series of his experiments, Signor
Mantegazza informs us, were tried on twelve animals, chiefly rabbits
and guinea pigs, of which several were pregnant. One poor little
creature, "far advanced in pregnancy," was made to endure <i>dolori
atrocissimi</i>, so that it was impossible to make any observations in
consequence of its convulsions.</p>

<p>In the second series of experiments twenty-eight animals were
sacrificed, some of them taken from nursing their young, exposed to
torture for an hour or two, then allowed to rest an hour, and usually
replaced in the machine to be crushed or torn by the Professor for
periods of from two to six hours more. In the table wherein these
experiments are summed up, the terms <i>molto dolore</i> and <i>crudeli
dolori</i> are delicately distinguished, the latter being apparently
reserved for the cases when the victims were, as the Professor
expresses it, <i>lardellati di chiodi</i>&mdash;("larded with nails").</p>

<p>In conclusion, the author informs us (p. 25) that these experiments
were all conducted "<i>con molto amore e pazienza!</i>"&mdash;with much
zeal and patience.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
In a controversy with Dr. Pye-Smith, who had read a paper before the
British Association, Miss Cobbe writes as follows to one of the public
journals:</p>

<p>"Dr. Pye-Smith is reported to have said: 'Happily, the neccessary
experiments were comparatively few.' Few! What are a "few" experiments?
Professor Schiff in ten years experimented on 14,000 dogs, given over
to him by the Municipality of Florence, and returned their carcases so
mangled that the man who had contracted for their skins found them
useless. He also experimented on pigeons, cats, and rabbits to the
number, it is calculated, of 70,000 creatures; and he now asks for ten
dogs a week in Geneva. All over Germany and France there are laboratories
"using" (as the horrible phrase is) numberless animals, inasmuch as I
have just received a letter stating that dogs are actually becoming
scarce in Lyons, and it is proposed to breed them for the purpose of
Vivisection. Be this true or not, I invite any of your readers to visit
the office of the Victoria Street Society, and examine the volumes of
splendid plates of vivisecting instruments, which will there be shown
them, and then judge for themselves whether it be for a few experiments
that those elaborate and costly inventions have become a regular branch
of manufacture. Let them examine the volume of the English handbook of
the physiological laboratory, the volume of Cyon's magnificent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
atlas, with its 54 plates, the <i>Archives de Physiologie</i>, with its
191 plates, the <i>Physiologische Methodik</i>, or Claude Bernard's
<i>Le&ccedil;ons sur la Chaleur Animale</i>, with its pictures of the
stoves wherein he baked dogs and rabbits alive; and after these sights
of disgust and horror they will know how to understand the word "few"
in the vocabulary of a physiologist. I am glad to hear that a German
opponent of Vivisection recently entering a shop devoted to the sale
of these tools of torture, was greeted by the proprietor with a volley
of abuse: 'It is you and your friends,' he said, 'who are destroying
my trade. I used to sell a hundred of Czermak's tables and other
instruments for one I sell now.'</p>

<p>"Dr. Pye-Smith said: 'Many of the experiments inflicted no pain or
injury whatever, and the great majority of the rest were rendered
painless by the use of those beneficial agents which abolished pain
and had themselves been discovered by experiments upon living
animals.' As to the use of an&aelig;sthetics in annulling the
agonies of mutilated animals, the audience ought to have asked
Dr. Pye-Smith to explain whether he intended to refer to chloroform,
or the narcotic morphia, or, lastly, to the drug <i>curare</i>. If he
referred to chloroform, Dr. Hoggan tells from his own experience
(<i>An&aelig;sthetics</i>, p. 1), that 'nothing can be more uncertain than
its influence on the lower animals; many of them die before they become
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
insensible. Complete and conscientious an&aelig;sthesia is seldom even
attempted, the animal getting at most a slight whiff of chloroform
<i>by way of satisfying the conscience of the operator</i>, or enabling
him to make statements of a humane character.' Even if it were
conscientiously administered at the beginning of an experiment, how little
would chloroform diminish the misery of Rutherford's dogs or Brunton's
ninety cats, whose long-drawn agonies extended over many days? How
little could it affect in any way the cases of starving, poisoning,
baking, stewing to death, or burning,&mdash;like the twenty-five dogs over
which Professor Wertheim poured turpentine and then set them on fire,
leaving them afterwards slowly to perish? If Dr. Pye-Smith was
thinking of morphia, the reader may refer to Claude Bernard's <i>Le&ccedil;ons
de Physiologie Operatoire</i>, where he will find that great
physiologists recommends its use; but at the same time mentions (as of
no particular consequence) that the animal subjected to its influence
still 'suffers pain.' I can hardly suppose, lastly, that Dr. Pye-Smith
was secretly thinking of <i>curare</i>, and that he is one of those whom
Tennyson says would</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Mangle the living dog which loved him and fawned at his knee,<br />
Drenched with the hellish oorali."<br />
</p></div>

<p>It is bad enough to "mangle" a loving and intelligent creature without
adding to its agonies the paralysis of the powers of motion, and the increased
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
sensibility to pain occasioned by this horrible drug, which
nevertheless Bernard, in the work above quoted, says is in such common
use among physiologists, that when an experiment is not otherwise
described, it may always be "taken for granted it has been performed
on a curarized dog."</p>

<p>Finally, Dr. Pye-Smith says, "It was remarkable that the small residue
of experiments in which some amount of pain was necessary were chiefly
those in which the direct and immediate benefit to mankind was more
obvious. He referred to the trying of drugs on animals, to discovering
antidotes to poisons," etc. The bribe here offered to human
selfishness is an ingenious one. "Let us," the physiologists say,
"retain the right to put animals to torture, for it is very
'remarkable' that when we do so it is always in your interest!"
Unluckily for this appeal to the meaner feelings of human nature,
which these modern instructors of our young men are not ashamed to put
forward, it is difficult for them to hit on any one instance wherein
out of their "few" (million) experiments any good to mankind has been,
even apparently, achieved. As Claude Bernard honestly said, at least
as regards any benefit for suffering humanity, "<i>Nos mains sont
vides</i>." As to the trying of drugs on animals, Dr. Pritchard,
who is, I believe, the best living authority on the subject,
told the Royal Commission (Minutes, 908), "I do not think
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
that the use of drugs on animals can be taken as a guide to the doses
or to the action of the same drugs on the human subjects." As to the
discovery of antidotes to poison, the only man who seems on the verge
of any success is the brave and noble fellow who has been trying such
experiments not on animals but on himself.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I must add one word on Dr. Pye-Smith's last sentence,
namely, "that legislation against vivisection is injurious to the best
interests of the community." Sir, I know not what vivisectors deem to
be the best interests of the community. For my part I do not reckon
them to be the influence of drugs, nor yet susceptible of being carved
out with surgical instruments. I do not think that they consist in
escape from physical pain, nor even in the prolongation for a few
years of our little earthly life. I hold that the best interests of
the community are the moral and immortal interests of every soul in
such community, namely, the conquest of selfishness, cowardice, and
cruelty, and the development of the god-like sense of justice and
love&mdash;the growth of the divinest thing in human nature, the faculty of
sympathizing with the joys and sorrows of all God's creatures.
Believing these to be "the best interests of the community," I ask,
without hesitation, for the suppression of this abominable trade,
which can best be described as "Pitilessness practised as a profession."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
If vivisection be indeed the true method of studying physiology, if
physiology cannot be advanced except by vivisection, if chemical
observation and microscopic research be useless for the purpose, and
nothing but the torture of animals and the demoralization of men will
suffice for its progress&mdash;then, in God's name, I say, let
physiology stop at the point it has reached, even till the day of
doom.&mdash;I am, Sir, with apologies for the length of this letter,
yours, etc.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Frances Power Cobbe</span></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>Certainly, as regards the ethics of vivisection, nothing more eloquent
has ever been written than this closing paragraph.</p>

<p>In a letter to the London <span class="smcap">Times</span> in December,
1884, Miss Cobbe writes as follows:</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">TO THE EDITOR.</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In your article on this subject on Saturday last you called
upon the opponents of vivisection to answer certain questions. As I
have been intrusted for many years with the hon. secretaryship of the
leading anti-vivisectionist society, I beg to offer you the following
replies to those questions:&mdash;</p>

<p>You ask first, Do we "deny that vivisection is capable of yielding
knowledge of service to man?" We are not so rash as to deny that any
practice, even the most immoral conceivable, might possibly yield
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
knowledge of service to man; and, in particular, we do not deny that
the vivisection of human beings by the surgeons of classic times, and
again by the great anatomists of Italy in the 15th century, may very
possibly have yielded knowledge to man, and be capable, if revived, of
yielding still more. We have, however, for a long time back called on
the advocates of the vivisection of dogs, monkeys, &amp;c., to furnish
evidence of the beneficial results of their work, not as setting at
rest the question of its morality, but as an indispensable preliminary
to justify them in coming into the court of public opinion as
defendants of a practice obviously (as the Royal Commissioners
reported) "liable from its very nature to great abuse."</p>

<p>We must be excused if we now hold it to be demonstrated that, whether
vivisection be or be not "capable of yielding useful knowledge," it
certainly yields only a scanty crop of it. Were there anything like an
abundant harvest, such a sample as this would not have been produced
with so much pomp for public scrutiny. In short, we think with Dr.
Leffingwell that, "if pain could be measured by money, there is no
mining company in the world which would sanction prospecting in such
barren regions."</p>

<p>You ask us, Sir, secondly, "Do we affirm that the benefit of mankind
is not an adequate or sufficient justification for the infliction of
pain on animals?" We have two answers to this question.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Assuming that by vivisection benefits might be obtained for human
bodies, we hold that the evil results of the practice on human minds
would more than counterbalance any such benefits. The cowardice and
pitilessness involved in tying down a dog on a table and slowly
mangling its brain, its eyes, its entrails; the sin committed against
love and fidelity themselves when a creature capable of dying of grief
on his master's grave is dealt with as a mere parcel of material
tissues, "valuable for purposes of research"&mdash;these are basenesses
for which no physical advantages would compensate, and the prevalence
of such a heart-hardening process among our young men would, we are
convinced, detract more from the moral interests of our nation than a
thousand cases of recovery from disease would serve those of a lower
kind. Even life itself ought not to be saved by such methods, any more
than by the cannibalism of the men of the "Mignonette."</p>

<p>Our second answer is yet more brief. We do not "deny that the
benefit of man is a sufficient justification for inflicting pain upon
animals," provided that pain is kept within moderate bounds, nor yet
to taking life from them in a quick and careful manner. But we do deny
the right of man to inflict torture upon brutes, and thus convert
their lives from a blessing into a curse. Such torture has been
inflicted upon tens of thousands of animals by vivisection; and no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
legislation that ingenuity can devise will, we believe, suffice to
guard against the repetition of it so long as it is sanctioned in any
way as a method of research. The use of vivisection&mdash;if it have any
use&mdash;is practically inseparable from abuse. We therefore call upon our
countrymen to forego the poor bribes of possible use which are offered
to them, and of which we have now seen a "unique and impressive"
example, and generously and manfully to say of vivisection as they
once said of slavery "We will have none of it."</p>

<h3>II.<br />

<small>[<i>Report of American Anti-vivisection Society, Jan. 1888.</i>]</small></h3>


<p>"There remain two grounds to adopt: one the total abolition of all
experiments; the other the total abolition of all <i>painful</i>
experiments. This latter position, which is the one that Dr. Bigelow
of Boston and Dr. Leffingwell have assumed, has engaged our attention
for a long time; but, after bestowing upon it careful consideration,
we feel that we must give it up as impracticable. To secure immunity
from pain there must be absolutely perfect an&aelig;sthesia. This can be
only obtained in two ways: one is by trusting to the experimenter
himself to give sufficient of the an&aelig;sthetic; the other to insist that
an assistant shall be present for the express purpose of keeping the
animal under perfect an&aelig;sthesia. Now is it anyway likely that either
of these conditions would be observed?"</p>


<h3>III.<br />

<small>[<i>From the "Therapeutic Gazette," Detroit, Aug., 1880.</i>]</small></h3>

<p>"Vivisection is grossly abused in the United States. * * We would add
our condemnation of the ruthless barbarity which is every winter perpetrated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
in the Medical Schools of this country. History records some
frightful atrocities perpetrated in the name of Religion; but it
has remained for the enlightenment and humaneness of this century to
stultify themselves by tolerating the abuses of the average
physiological laboratory&mdash;all conducted in the name of Science. There
is only one way to progress in Therapeutics; and that is by clinical
observation; the noting of the action of individual drugs under
particular diseased conditions. He who has the largest practice and is
the keenest observer, and the most systematic recorder of what he
sees, does the most to advance Medicine."</p>


<h3>IV.<br />

<small>[<i>From editorial in "The Spectator," London, July 17, 1880.</i>]</small></h3>

<p>"A memorial for the absolute abolition of vivisection has been
presented to Mr. Gladstone with a great many most influential
signatures attached. For our own part, were the experiments on the
inoculation of animal diseases excepted,&mdash;experiments which,
we venture to say, have sometimes proved of the greatest value to
animals themselves,&mdash;we should, on the whole, be content to
go with the abolitionists, not because we think all experiments,
especially when conducted under strict an&aelig;sthetics, wrong,
but because when they are permitted at all it is so extremely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
difficult to enforce properly and fully humane conditions. Dr. A.
Leffingwell has sufficiently shown in the able paper in the July
<i>Scribner's Magazine</i>, how extremely few remedies of value have
resulted from this awfully costly expenditure of anguish. 'If pain
could be estimated in money' he justly says, 'no corporation would be
satisfied with such a waste of capital.' Take, as the single
illustration of this most weighty sentence, Dr. Leffingwell's
statement that what the late Dr. Sharpey called 'Magendie's infamous
experiment' on the stomach of the dog, has been repeated 200 times
without establishing to the satisfaction of scientific physiologists
the theory for which that act of wickedness was first committed. No
wonder the society for the Protection of Animals from Vivisection goes
to extremes."</p>
